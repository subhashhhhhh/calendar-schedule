# SimpleSchedule (IN DEVELOPMENT)
A simple website for students to get the schedule for their subgroups and add it to their calendar app of choice.

## How to use it?
It's simple. I decided to keep the UI and look of the website easy to understand.
1. Select your year of study
2. Select your branch
3. Select your subgroup
4. Now "Download an ICS File"

Thanks for using this website!üôè
