# SimpleSchedule
A simple website for students to get the schedule for their subgroups and add it to their calendar app of choice.

**Inspired from [Timetable Generator](https://timetable.mlsctiet.com) by MLSC TIET**

## How to use it?
It's simple. I decided to keep the UI and look of the website easy to understand.
1. Select your year of study
2. Select your branch
3. Select your subgroup
4. Click on Download button
5. Open the downloaded ICS File and it opens Google Calendar app.
6. Now, click on "Add all" on the top of the screen.

Thanks for using this website!üôè
